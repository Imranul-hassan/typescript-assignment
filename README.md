A Comprehensive Comparison of TypeScript Type vs Interface

TypeScript is a tool that builds on top of JavaScript and adds types to your code. This helps catch mistakes early and makes your code easier to understand. In TypeScript, you can describe the shape of data using types or interfaces. They seem very similar, so it can be confusing to know which one to use. In this post, we’ll explain the main differences between type and interface in a simple way, and show you when to use each.

TypeScript types

In TypeScript, type is used to define the kind of data a variable can hold. This includes basic types like string, number, and boolean, as well as custom ones.

A type alias lets you give a name to a type without creating a new one. You also need to use type when working with union types (like string | number).

Tuples in TypeScript let you create an array with a fixed number of items, where each item can have a different type. You can only define tuples using the type keyword.

TypeScript interfaces

In TypeScript, an interface is used to define the structure of an object. It tells what properties an object should have and what types those properties should be.

Interfaces are mainly used for working with objects and classes. They are also easy to extend, so you can add more properties later or combine multiple interfaces.


Key Differences Between Types and Interfaces

One big difference is that type can be used with primitive values like string, number, or boolean, but interface cannot.

type Name = string;  //  Works
// interface Name = string;  Invalid

Both type and interface can define the shape of an object, meaning they describe what properties an object should have and their types.

type UserType = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

interface UserInterface {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

Both type and interface can be extended to build on existing structures:
interface uses extends
type uses & (intersection)

// Interface extending
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}
interface Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;
}

// Type combining
type AnimalType = { name: string };
type DogType = AnimalType & { breed: string };

Conclusion

TypeScript’s type and interface are both great tools to help you write clear and organized code. While they seem similar, they each have special uses.
By knowing when to use type or interface, you can make your code cleaner, easier to understand, and more powerful.
So as you work with TypeScript, remember their differences and use the one that fits best. This will help you build stronger, more reliable projects — and enjoy coding even more!
